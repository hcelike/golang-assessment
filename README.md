# Test tasks

Important:
* [x] tasks must be documented as if it was a programming tasks (documented for programmers)
* [x] task must be implemented with Go and  GIT
* [x] task MUST include commits for every logical block of work. It is expected to have frequent commits with meaningful messages, preferably multiple commits per-function.
* [x] as a solution submit your Git repo URL


### String Specs

Given a string that is a sequence of numbers followed by dash followed by text, eg: 23-ab-48-caba-56-haha
   * The numbers can be assumed to be unsigned integers
   * The strings can be assumed to be ASCII sequences of arbitrary length larger than 0 (empty strings not allowed).

## Task 1 

* Before implementing the needed function, please estimate the difficulty of the functions and report the estimated and the used time to implement the functions in the function comment block.
* Write a function testValidity that takes the string as an input, and returns boolean flag true if the given string complies with the format, or false if the string does not comply
* Write a function averageNumber that takes the string, and returns the average number from all the numbers
* Write a function wholeStory that takes the string, and returns a text that is composed from all the text words separated by spaces, e.g. story called for the string 1-hello-2-world should return text: "hello world"
* Write a function storyStats that returns four things:
   * the shortest word
   * the longest word
   * the average word length
   * the list (or empty list) of all words from the story that have the length the same as the average length rounded up and down.

# Task 2

* Before implementing the needed function, please estimate the difficulty of the functions and report the estimated and the used time to implement the functions in the function comment block.
* Write a generate function, that takes boolean flag and generates random correct strings if the parameter is true and random incorrect strings if the flag is false.
* Write unit tests for the functions:
   * testValidity
   * averageNumber
   * wholeStory
   * storyStats`
